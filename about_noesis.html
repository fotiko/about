              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Initially, the Copenhagen Center for Health Technology (CACHET) was interested in building a digital version of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test to include in their SaaS healthcare platform. During this widely used neuropsychological assessment, the examinee is given a piece of paper and a pencil. Then a stimulus figure is placed in front of them (figure A, in the image below). The test is conducted in 3 stages:
                <br><b>Copy:</b> Then they are asked to reproduce the figure to the best of their ability.
                <br><b>Immediate recall:</b> After a short delay, the examinee is asked to reproduce the figure from memory.
                <br><b>Delayed recall:</b> After a longer delay (20-30 minutes), the examinee may again be asked to draw the figure from memory.</p>

              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Since its creation by the Swiss psychologist André Rey in 1941 and later, its standardization by Paul-Alexandre Osterrieth in 1944, the process has barely changed. Having worked with several other assessments, CACHET was interested in digitalizing this test and implement an automated evaluation feature to it. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that guides users through a series of assessments, offers insightful feedback and creates a diagnostic report which could be reviewed by an expert.</p>

                To ensure the accuracy of the project's intended functionality and get a better understanding, we scheduled an in person meeting with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/frederiksbergneuropsykologiske/startside">Jens Richardt Møllegaard Jepsen</a>, an expert in the field. Jens is a senior researcher at the research unit of child and adolescent psychiatry center in Copenhagen, and has many years of immense experience. During this meeting I had the chance to experience various tests and how they are performed today, using paper and pencil. We then discussed the concept, purpose and goals of the project. Jens pointed out several complicated processes that contribute to the overall evaluation of the subject, which he believed to be the reason these test are still performed in the same way as they were 60-70 years ago.

                <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_interviews.jpg" alt="Interviews">
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">In communication with a psychiatrist, we organized interviews with 10 of his patients and himself. I also contacted a DTU assistant professor and invited 15 of her students, to form a mixed group. The interviews were performed individually, in a qualitative manner in Frederiksberg.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Interview goals</h4>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>What would the user expectations be for such an app?</li>
                <li>Can a digital tool accurately substitute the existing process?</li>
                <li>What is beinng tested eventually? Is it executive functions?</li>
                <li>Which obstacles would arise and was Jens right in having doubts?</li>
                <li>What would trigger them in download the app to their device?</li>
                <li>Observe user behaviour while performing some current tests.</li>
                <li>Overcome usability issues, of such a sensitive user group.</li>
                <li>How will the automated scoring be implemented?</li>

              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Using the data from my research and the interviews, I defined six user types and created the corresponding personas, to better empathize with my main user groups and prioritize goals according to their needs.</p>
                <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_Personas.jpg" alt="Personas">
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">To add a realistic note and enhance empathy, I added an AI generated profile picture to each persona. By making personas more realistic, will help the team and myself to think from the user's perspective during the design process and help counteract the biases during the design process, by enhancing awarness of different user groups and their unique needs. This will lead to a more inclusive and user-friendly designs.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Mapping</h4>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The next step was the mapping. To clarify, because I have seen several colleagues confusing this process. In UX, there are 4 types of mapping, which are: Empathy, Journey, Story, and Experience mapping. Each one has differnet a purpose, explained briefly below.
                An empathy map is a tool used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user and helps team members understand the user's mindset. A journey map focuses on a specific customer's interaction, when trying to accomplish a task. It's used for understanding and addressing customer needs and pain points. So, it's always from the perspective of the user. On the other hand, a story map is from the perspective of the product and what it takes to deliver the user experience. An experience map generalizes the concept of customer-journey maps across user groups and products. This one is used for understanding a general human behavior, unlike a journey map which is focused for specific tasks.</p>
                <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_USM.jpg" alt="USM">
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">With the above into consideration, I created an Empathy map to better understand the users' challenges, motivations, and context, leading to a more user-friendly and impactful cognitive assessment app. Then proceeded with the USM, to map out the entire user journey within the app, from the moment they log in, to the point they complete an assessment or receive feedback.</p>

              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Starting with low-fidelity paper prototypes, the general structure of the application could easily be tested, without much effort or the risk of getting attached to a premature design. In that way I was able to keep the emphasis on functionality rather than aesthetics.</p>
                <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_Wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframes">
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Because they are quick and simple to create, lo-fi wireframes can be tested and iterated rapidly. I mapped out the user flow and validated whether the steps made sense from a user perspective. That way I was able to see how users will navigate through the cognitive assessment, access progress reports, or sign up for different cognitive challenges.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Styleguide</h4>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The visual design was developed by iterating from mood boards and styletiles to the UI kit and finally to creating a first version of the styleguide, seen on the right side. The name of the app was chosen to be noesis, a Greek term for the exercise of reason and the functioning of the intellect, which refers to cognition. The main color of the app is rgba (0, 72, 103, 1). The combination of green and blue is commonly used in health-related environments, as green is considered the color of nature, thus representing health, while blue usually promotes tranquility. In that context, it is reminded that if a doctor's outfit is not white (e.g. surgeons), it is most often blue or green. The application's global font-type is Calibri in different sizes and weights, explained in the styleguide. Calibri is one a very popular font, clear and easy to read, while its popularity will also enhance familiarity.</p>
                <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_Styleguide_W.jpg" alt="Styleguide">
              <h4>A/B & Click Tests</h4>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">To quantitatively review the usability assumptions, I did A/B and click tests, which confirmed my assumptions except for a few details. First and foremost, I tested the navigation structure on tablet (with and without a pen tool), the wording of some actions as well as preferences regarding the visual design.</p>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">For testing the app, the prototype was given to six individuals and a psychiatrist, at two different times and in a non-clinical setup. The psychiatrist was giving them the test, while I was observing and taking notes in the background. The participants representing the patients, were three female subjects aged 14, 43, 83 and three male subjects of 49, 87 and 39 years of age, all having different educational backgrounds. The 83 year-old female subject had been previously diagnosed with onset dementia. The youngest of the subjects with a mild Asperger's syndrome and the 39 year-old, with depression and OCD, who was under prescribed medication for.
              <br>The test was performed in a think aloud manner, for a better understanding on whether the intended actions resulted to the corresponding interactions. For most of them, the process was smooth and straightforward. Only the two older participants were at time uncertain of whether what they were doing was "right" and the psychiatrist had to intervene briefly. It was later explained that it was a fear of doing something wrong or damaging the device, rather than not understanding what was happening on screen. The rest had very similar reactions and remarks.</p>
              <br><h4>Final iteration</h4>
              <br><img src="images/project-noesis/noesis_v2.jpg" alt="Screens">
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The final iteration kept the idea of the multi-cognitive test app. The main users are healthcare professionals. Research showed clearly that the only way for such an app to ensure the ecological validity, is if they are the ones who guide and control the entire process.</p>

                  <li><p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">→ While personas are valuable tools for user-centered design, there are some potential pitfalls and challenges associated with their use.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">→ It's essential to create personas based on rigorous research, update them as needed, use them as guiding tools rather than rigid rules, and supplement them with real user feedback and usability testing as soon as possible.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">→ Another very important consideration is the amount of complexity. Too much complexity early in the product's life-cycle might prove to be another pitfall. Prioritizing and holding back ideas for future releases, can be a good strategy.</p></li>
                  <li><p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">→ A project's success is grounded in the practicality of thorough research and frequent testing!</p></li>
