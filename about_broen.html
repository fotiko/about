              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">For a broader understanding of the problem we had several meetings with the stakeholder from Hofor and also the Development Manager of BIOFOS. They are the major wastewater handling companies in Denmark. BIOFOS for instance treats the water of 1,2 million households and hundreds of companies in the metropolitan area. There have 3 wastewater-treatment facilities, in Lynetten, Damhusåen and Avedøre. After the mechanical cleaning procedure, which removes objects, is completed the second phase of biological and the chemical purifications follows.</p>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The main issue is that when the system is very busy (e.g. in case of a storm, or continuous rain), the second phase is being bypassed and water is channeled directly to the sea. Another big issue is that most municipalities have an old sewage system, where both black sewage and rainwater is combined into one pipe. In the 50s there was a Cholera outbreak due to bacteria from the wastewater infiltrating into the clean water. During the 60s, they started separating the wastewater into two lines, but still most systems, especially in Copenhagen's center, they are still combined.
                The problem becomes even bigger, as municipalities don't work together, unable to understand it's a common problem. Until recently, there was no communication between them. Each municipality is only concered about getting rid of their wastewater, without thinking how it effects the entirety of the sewage system. The ideal scenario would be for each municipality to know in advance the wastewater it will receive and to be able to temporarily hold it, until the treatment facilities tell them that they can receive it for processing.</p>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The current technologies for measuring rainfall currently include x-band radars and 250 rain gauges spread around Denmark. The measurements from radars are heavily impacted by factors like the wind, thus they don't give an accurate indication of how, if, or where the rain will fall. Furthermore, the measurements from the rain gauges work in a way that makes it difficult to predict the rainfall in between the measured points. Additionally, in regard to wastewater flow in the sewers, at the moment, it is being measured in only 8 places in the greater Copenhagen area.
                <br>When it comes to existing solutions regarding the sewage system responsiveness and regulating the flow, it's been done manually (basically one guy calling another). In 2020, they started adding some kind of automation. It is an online app which municipalities have access to, which shows (interactively) what the status of the system is and also what each municipality sends down to the system. With this app they hope to avoid overloads. The current way of measuring a gully's efficiency is by using a sensor by DRYP, which measures the level of water inside the gullies. It is placed right under the metallic mesh, which is very close to street level, to achive network connectivity.</p>

              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">For a broader understanding of the problem we had several meetings with the stakeholder from Hofor and also the Development Manager of BIOFOS. They are the major wastewater handling companies in Denmark. BIOFOS for instance treats the water of 1,2 million households and hundreds of companies in the metropolitan area. There have 3 wastewater-treatment facilities, in Lynetten, Damhusåen and Avedøre. After the mechanical cleaning procedure, which removes objects, is completed the second phase of biological and the chemical purifications follows.</p>
              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">The main issue is that when the system is very busy (e.g. in case of a storm, or continuous rain), the second phase is being bypassed and water is channeled directly to the sea. Another big issue is that most municipalities have an old sewage system, where both black sewage and rainwater is combined into one pipe. In the 50s there was a Cholera outbreak due to bacteria from the wastewater infiltrating into the clean water. During the 60s, they started separating the wastewater into two lines, but still most systems, especially in Copenhagen's center, they are still combined.
                The problem becomes even bigger, as municipalities don't work together, unable to understand it's a common problem. Until recently, there was no communication between them. Each municipality is only concered about getting rid of their wastewater, without thinking how it effects the entirety of the sewage system. The ideal scenario would be for each municipality to know in advance the wastewater it will receive and to be able to temporarily hold it, until the treatment facilities tell them that they can receive it for processing.</p>

              <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">There were three main iterations. The first concept was following the bell siphon, or Archimedes' cup principle. A light sensor would be placed at the end of the siphon to measure the discharges and thus measure the amount of water entering the road gully. A 3D model was designed, then printed and the arduino-based sensor was added. The 3D printed design was tested and although it worked as expected, this concept was abandoned because of the fact that both the collecting chamber and the water's exit point would be easily clogged by debris from the street. The idea of installing a thin mesh on top would only delay this and eventually block the entire gully.
                <br>The second iteration involved a water collecting container with a mechanical lid. A floater would release the lid, when the container was full. Then a sensor would count the water discharge by how many times the lid had opened, emplying the container.
                <br>The third iteration was a spin-off of the second one. It also involved a water collecting container, but the container itself would tilt from side to side and. This change was made after concerns that the floater or the lid in iteration 2, could be jammed by leaves or debris that have managed to surpass gully's top rack. Equivalently, a sensor would count the water discharges by how many times the cup has switched sides. Using the Weighed Objectives Method (WOM), we concluded in continuing by building a prototype of the third iteration. </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInRight" align="justify">Together with the mechanical part of the prototype, an intuitive desktop app with a rather simple, yet appealing interface was created. Its purpose was to present the measurements and settings of the mechanism. A future adaptation shown below, would also be include the following. Apart form an interactive map with all the smart-gullies, weather data from the DMI, together with predictions and analysis, detailed remote control of the device and also a flood alert.</p>
